# Hostel_program
 Course project
 
The program works with three text files.
In 1 are the registered guests.
2 contains the rooms in the hostel.
In 3 there is information about checked-in rooms and who is in them.
A hash-map is used for 1.
For 2, the AVL tree is used.
For 3, a one-way linear list is used.
